### Dataset of Extreme Poses
Visit these shared drive links to download the [*ExPose*](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HQDMIbbwHWerr8AXfPf08K1cwR-G1z7Y?usp=sharing) and the [*G-ExPose*](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sStYPEtPnggp0mI5VrCwzyg5qtk2c39u?usp=sharing) datasets.

### Dependencies
This code requires the following:
* python 2.7.15+ or python 3.5+
* PyTorch v1.0+

### Instructions
First, download the [*AQA-7*](http://rtis.oit.unlv.edu/datasets.html) dataset samples and put the raw videos under `AQA_dataset/SportName_raw`. Then run the `AQA_dataset/video2img.py` to extract the frames of the videos. By default, the appearance dynamics assessment stream of the network uses the I3D features of these frames.\  EAGLE-Eye further requires the pose features of a routine to assess it. We entangled the [*DiMP*](https://github.com/visionml/pytracking) visual object tracker with [*HRNet*](https://github.com/HRNet/HRNet-Human-Pose-Estimation) pose estimator to get the pose sequence of the videos. The resulted pose heatmaps should be located under `AQA_dataset/SportName_heatmaps`. Finally, run the `AQA_head/experiments/train_model_AQA.py` to train and test the network on the *AQA-7* dataset. You may adjust the network parameters on `AQA_head/configs/config_py.py`.
